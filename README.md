# [GitHub Feels](http://github-feels.edgeapp.net/)

A fun little application which grabs GitHub repository issues from GitHub's GraphQL API and stitches it together with a sentiment API. Essentially it will try to determine whether or not each issue is written in a positive, negative or neutral tone. Oh, and btw, there's some awesome UI to go with it! I had a lot of fun with Chart.js!

The backend uses [Fly.io](https://www.fly.io)'s awesome edge hosting!
